## Introduction to Apache Spark
## IBM Proof of Technology

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, and Python, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured
data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing. <http://spark.apache.org/>

## Hands on Labs
IBM created basic labs to help people learn Apache Sparl. 

To perform these labs, get on IBM's free Data Science platform at <http://datascience.ibm.com/>

Labs: <br>
Lab 1 - Intro - Use Spark Context, Create basic RDDs<br>
Lab 2 - SQL - Use SQL Context, Write SQL to perform basic transformations<br>
Lab 3 - Machine Learning - Use Spark ML, Create a Machine Learning Model<br>
